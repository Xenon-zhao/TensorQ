- quick_start


a simple example, simulating a circuit with a H gate by TensorQ, comparing with Cirq.

- quick_start_advance


simulating a circuit to creata 35 qubits GHZ state by TensorQ. While Cirq can't simulate this circuit, because Cirq need too much memory.

- quick_start_MindQuantum


simulating a circuit with a H gate by Tensorq, and the circuit is generated by MindQuantum.

- quick_start_MindQuantum_advance

simulating a circuit to creata 35 qubits GHZ state by TensorQ. While MindQuantum can't simulate this circuit, because MindQuantum need too much memory.

- simulate_sycamore

simulating 30 qubit random circuit sampling experiment, like the Sycamore quantum computer of Google.
